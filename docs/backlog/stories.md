## User Stories
---
User stories are a simple way to capture a requirement for a product. They are written from the perspective of the user and describe a unit of desired functionality. User stories are often written on index cards and organized on a wall or board. This helps the team to visualize the product backlog and prioritize the user stories based on their importance.
