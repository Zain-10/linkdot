## Backlog
---
Backlog is a tool that is commonly used in Agile software development to help teams manage their development process. Here's how you can use Backlog to manage your software development process:

Define the product backlog: The first step is to create a list of user stories and features that you want to include in your product. This will serve as the product backlog.

Prioritize the backlog: Once the product backlog is defined, you can prioritize the items in the backlog based on their importance to the product and your team. This will help you focus on delivering the most valuable features first.

Plan the sprint: Using the prioritized backlog, you can plan the next sprint by selecting a set of user stories to be completed within a specific time frame.

Track progress: During the sprint, you can use Backlog to track the progress of each user story. You can update the status of each story, add comments and attach relevant files as the work progresses.

Review and Retrospect: At the end of the sprint, you can review the work completed, reflect on the process and identify areas for improvement. This helps you to continuously improve your development process.

Repeat: The process of planning, tracking, and reviewing is repeated until the product is complete.

## User Stories
---
User stories are a simple way to capture a requirement for a product. They are written from the perspective of the user and describe a unit of desired functionality. User stories are often written on index cards and organized on a wall or board. This helps the team to visualize the product backlog and prioritize the user stories based on their importance.

### STR-01: As a user, I want to be able to connect my `wallet` to the app so that I can use the app.

### STR-02: As a user, I want to be able to see top `posts` and `profiles` so that I can see what's trending, without connecting my wallet.

### STR-03: As a user, I want to be able to `search` for users, posts, and comments so that I can find what I'm looking for without connecting my wallet.

### STR-04: As a user, I want to be able to see my `profile` so that can see my `posts` and `follow` other users.

### STR-05: As a user, I want to be able to create a `Proof of Work`(posts) so that I can showcase my skills and achievements.

### STR-06: As a user, I want to be able to show my credentials so that I can showcase my skills and achievements.

### STR-07: As a user, I want to be able to see other users' `profiles` so that I can follow them and see their posts.

### STR-08: As a user, I want to be able to see other users' `posts` so that I can see their `Proof of Work`.

### STR-09: As a user, I need to `invite collaborators` to my `Proof of Work` so that they can contribute to it.

### STR-10: As a user, I need to be able to see the `Proof of Work` of other users so that I can see and `endorse` their work.
