## Purpose

The app needs to have a landing page which will be the first page that the user will see when they visit the app. The users can navigate to this route withouth being connected to the app.

## Requirements

- The landing page should have the following components:
  - `Search` component
  - List of `Trending` profiles
  - `Wallet` connect component


## Proposed Work

- Use the `index.tsx` file located at `src/pages/index.tsx` to build the landing page

- Build the `Search` component
- Build the `Trending` profiles component
- Build the `Wallet` connect component

**Important**: All the components are already built. You just need to use them and modify them to fit the new design. Make use of them as much as possible.


## Acceptance Criteria

- successful build of the landing page
- successful build of the `Search` component
- successful build of the `Trending` profiles component
- successful build of the `Wallet` connect component
- Use the existing components to build the landing page
