## Proposed Work

- Use the `index.tsx` file located at `src/pages/index.tsx` to build the landing page

- Build the `Search` component
- Build the `Trending` profiles component
- Build the `Wallet` connect component
- Add social media links in the footer section
  1. Instagram - connect vijin to get the link
  2. Twitter - https://twitter.com/Linkdotoff
  3. LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkdot/

**Important**: All the components are already built. You just need to use them and modify them to fit the new design. Make use of them as much as possible.


## Acceptance Criteria
