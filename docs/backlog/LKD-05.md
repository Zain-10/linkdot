## Purpose

The app needs to have `Proof of Work` creation logic. The logic will be used to create a new `Proof of Work` from the `Create Proof of Work` modal component.

## Requirements

- Do research on how to create a `Proof of Work` on using the `LENS` protocol
- Find out how to keep track of the `Proof of Work` on the LENS `Post` contract, to filter out the `Proof of Work` created by the app among all the `Posts` created on the LENS protocol
- Find out fields that are required to create a `Proof of Work` on the LENS protocol, and how to upload files to create a `Proof of Work`
- Implement the logic to create a `Proof of Work`.

## Proposed Work

- Write a document on how to create a `Proof of Work` on the LENS protocol
- Write logic to handle the form data and create a `Proof of Work` on the LENS protocol
- Add necessary functions to handle the `Proof of Work` creation logic

## Acceptance Criteria

- Document on how to create a `Proof of Work` on the LENS protocol
- Logic to handle the form data and create a `Proof of Work` on the LENS protocol
- Necessary functions to handle the `Proof of Work` creation logic

## Notes

- This task is dependent on [LKD-06-Authentication](./LKD-06.md)
