## Purpose

The app needs to have a modal component that will be used to create a new `Proof of Work`. The component can be opened from the `Create Proof of Work` button in the `Sidebar` component and the `Create Proof of Work` button in the `Profile` page only if the user is logged in.

## Requirements

- The modal component should have the following components:
  - Create `Proof of Work` form
  - `Proof of Work` preview 
  - Cancel button
  - Publish button
  - close button (top right corner)

## Proposed Work

- Build the `Create Proof of Work` modal component that can be opened all pages for logged in users
- Create necessary components, files and functions to build the modal component.

**Note**: The logic(ie: handling form data, api call etc) for creating a `Proof of Work` will be handled in a separate task.


## Acceptance Criteria

- successful build of the `Create Proof of Work` modal component
- successful build of the `Create Proof of Work` form
- successful build of the `Proof of Work` preview
